# How long to clip artist/title tags to before displaying
CLIPLENGTH=25

# This is a big scary line that breaks down as follows:
# - mpc prints the artist tag on one line and the title on the next
# - awk replaces artist/title longer than CLIPLENGTH chars with exactly
#   CLIPLENGTH chars plus an ellipsis
# - sed collapses the first and second lines only
#
# The idea is that sometimes there are songs tagged with very long lists
# of people (esp. classical, soundtrack, musicals).  These get too long
# and push other meters out of view.  So, for instance
#
#   Leslie Odom Jr., Anthony Ramos, Daveed Diggs, Okieriete Onaodowan, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Phillipa Soo, Christopher Jackson & Cast - Alexander Hamilton
#
# gets trimmed to
#
#   Leslie Odom Jr., Anthony Ramos… - Alexander Hamilton
#
# which is a lot more reasonable, I think we can all agree on that
